        Louisville Books to Prisoners is an all-volunteer organization. We need volunteers to help perform the following tasks:
        Sorting, picking and packing books
        Contacting additional facilities to obtain authorization to ship
        Managing our social media (Facebook and soon Instagram)
        Fundraising to meet 2019 goals: 50% increase in number of inmates reached</p>

      <p>
        We are a 501c3 organization and your donations are tax deductible. With anticipated requests in 2019, our work is only made possible by donors like you. We are 100% volunteer driven and our only significant operational costs are postage and packing materials. It costs, on average, $1.50 to send one book directly to a prisoner in our service area</p>
